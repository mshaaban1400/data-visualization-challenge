What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?

### Background

In this assignment, we applied what we've learned about Matplotlib to a real-world situation and dataset. As the new senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications, the first job to complete was to generate all of the figures and tables needed for the technical report of the most recent animal study from screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. We also had to generate a top-level summary of the study results.

### Instructions

The instructions for this assignment included:

* Prepare the data.

* Generate summary statistics.

* Create bar charts and pie charts.

* Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

* Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

* Calculate correlation and regression.

* Submit your final analysis.
